.h1 Photo websites

The generation of photo websites is done by a set of scripts that
are called via
.fix configyour.
Because all the website options have a comon need for images, the
creation of the images in the directories is done separately.

At the moment, the following options exist:

	src directory	purpose
	photo	Common part; generation of photos in different sizes.
	photoswipe	A website that alows swiping on phones, but no pinch to zoom
	htmlindex	A simple HTML-table with thumbnails that give access to the full-size image
	photozip	Allows the download of a tgz of the full-size images
