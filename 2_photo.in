.header
.h1 Photo (common part)

There three directories for images:

- 
.fix thumb
- 
.fix medium
- 
.fix fullsize

Thumbnail images are resized to fit in 300x300. Medium images are
1000x1000 and fullsize images are not resized.
A separate directory for HTML files is created.

Whether
.fix configyour
will create the photo-rules is determined by the pressence of a 
file 
.fix imagelist
in the current directory.
For all images in
.fix imagelist
rules are created for creating the files under 
.fix thumb, medium
and
.fix fullsize.

The
.fix imagelist
consists of a list of filenames and a number of directives.

	*directive*	*meaning*	*example*
	DIR directory	Get the files from this directory	DIR /links/diaadm/bewerkt
	TYPE gallerytype	Create gallery type	TYPE HTMLINDEX


Gallery-types must provide their own
configyour scripts. The photo configyour will provide an HTML header
.fix header.htm
that can be included.

The photo configyour will provide an index.html, which is a copy of the first 
gallery type in
.fix imagelist
and which will depend on all index files for the gallery types. These indexfiles
must be called
.fix index.gallerytype.html

The result will be 
.link htmlindex.html
